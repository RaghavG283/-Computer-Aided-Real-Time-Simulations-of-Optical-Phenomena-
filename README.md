# -Computer-Aided-Real-Time-Simulations-of-Optical-Phenomena-

In this project, we simulated various optical phenomena like Single Slit Diffraction, Snellâ€™s Law, Double Slit Interference, etc. on a computer using OpenCV and Python. We performed the same experiments in a lab and compared the experimental results with the results obtained from the simulation.
